"""FastAPI app for `zing serve` — serves the SPA and streams live audits over SSE.

Endpoints:
  GET  /                     the single-page app (classic UI)
  GET  /v2/…                 the v2 UI, served side by side for A/B comparison;
                             ?ui=v1|v2 on any page picks one (remembered in the
                             `zing_ui` cookie)
  GET  /v2/analytics         charts and leaderboards over the run history (v2 only)

  GET  /api/kb               providers (base URLs, saved relays) and their models
  POST /api/kb/relays        save a relay {name, base_url} in kb.db
  GET  /api/kb/profiles      models, providers and relays (complete sets, sources,
                             on/off state) + your kb.db entries

  POST /api/kb/import        check + store profile YAML in kb.db
  GET  /api/kb/export        your kb.db entries as YAML
  POST /api/models           list a relay's /models (connection check + model ids)
  POST /api/audit/stream     run an audit; stream detector progress, batched
                             per-request timing records and the final report
                             as Server-Sent Events (text/event-stream)
  POST /api/jobs             queue an audit (any surface: chat, embedding, rerank)
                             as a background job (same body as
                             /api/audit/stream); it runs on whatever page is open
  GET  /api/jobs             queued and running audits (and running monitors),
                             recently finished ones too, with progress
  GET  /api/jobs/{id}/events the job's events as SSE: the log so far, then live
  POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel stop a queued or running job
  POST /api/report/export    a report (JSON body) rendered as a download
                             (?format=json|md|html|pdf)
  GET  /api/analytics/options      filter values in the run history (relays,
                                   models, suites, stream modes, APIs, dates)
  GET  /api/analytics/summary      KPIs of a range vs. the previous range
  GET  /api/analytics/series       one metric per relay / model over time buckets
  GET  /api/analytics/leaderboard  relays of a model, or models of a relay
  GET  /api/analytics/breakdown    some metrics per relay / model over the range
  GET  /api/analytics/errors       request outcomes (429, 5xx, timeouts, …) per
                                   relay / model and over time buckets
  GET  /api/analytics/integrity    identity, context window and capability
                                   checks per relay x model
                                   (parameters: zing/web/analytics.py)
  GET  /api/secret           the monitors' master key: state, fingerprint,
                             allowed actions (never the key)
  POST /api/secret/new       a new master key, shown once …
  POST /api/secret/new/confirm  … and adopted once typed back {key}
  POST /api/secret/unlock    enter the master key {key} after a restart
  POST /api/secret/lock      forget it; monitors pause
  POST /api/secret/reset     the key is lost: drop the encrypted API keys

The audit runs in-process with the same `run_audit` the CLI uses; a progress
callback pushes per-detector events into a queue the SSE generator drains. The
final report is the model's own redacted `model_dump` (API key fingerprinted,
relay text scrubbed), so nothing secret crosses to the browser.

Every audit runs as a job (zing/web/jobs.py): audits of the same relay are
queued one after another so they never skew each other's measurements;
different relays run in parallel. /api/audit/stream ties its job to the
stream (closing the page stops it); /api/jobs detaches it from the page.
