"""Report renderers and writers.

The :class:`~zing.models.AuditReport` is the single source of truth; this package
turns it into the artifacts users consume: machine-readable JSON (the
LLM-facing API), human Markdown, a self-contained HTML page, and that page as a
PDF (optional ``pdf`` extra). ``write_reports``
persists the chosen format(s) to disk.
