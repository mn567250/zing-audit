"""Reliability detector — concurrent success rate & latency under load.

Fires a burst of identical tiny requests with bounded concurrency and measures
how many succeed and how fast they return. A relay that flakes, rate-limits, or
crawls under modest parallelism is a reliability risk even when single calls
look fine. Aggregated into a :class:`ReliabilitySummary` the runner surfaces.

Scoring follows the published ``SCALE`` (method "deductions"): the score starts
at 100, failed requests deduct their share (100 - success rate x 100; HTTP 429
throttling is excluded), and a high tail latency deducts 15% of what is left.
