"""The user's own knowledge-base entries — ``kb.db`` in the data directory.

Profiles added in the web UI (or imported from YAML) are stored here, so a user
without an editable install — or with only the UI — can add models and use
them for runs. :func:`zing.knowledge.load_knowledge_base` layers these entries
on top of the packaged YAML and ``ZING_KB_DIR`` for every command, so
``zing check`` and ``zing serve`` resolve exactly the same profiles.

One table, one row per entry:

* ``kind = 'model'``: a full :class:`~zing.knowledge.schema.ModelProfile` for
  ``provider``/``model_id``. It adds a model to that provider, or — the user's
  entries have the highest priority — replaces a packaged or ``ZING_KB_DIR``
  model with the same id (reported as *shadowing* it).
* ``kind = 'provider'``: provider-level data. For a provider that does not
  exist otherwise it is the whole provider (display name, hints, shared
  fingerprints, …). For an existing provider only its lists are used and merged
  in by id — ``fingerprints`` by ``id``, ``base_url_hints`` and
  ``relay_red_flags`` as a set union; single-value fields of a packaged
  provider are never overridden.

Bodies are stored as JSON and validated again on every load; an entry that no
longer validates (e.g. after an upgrade changed the schema) is skipped with a
warning rather than breaking every audit.
