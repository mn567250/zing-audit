"""Local audit history + trends — a tiny SQLite store, stdlib only.

`zing serve` persists every finished AuditReport here so the web app can show a
history table and per-target score trends. No new dependency: just `sqlite3`.

Storage lives in ``$ZING_DATA_DIR`` (default ``~/.zing``) as ``history.db``.
Every public function opens a fresh, short-lived connection so the module is
safe to call from FastAPI's threadpool without sharing a connection across
threads. Writes are best-effort: a malformed report must never break the audit
stream, so :func:`save` swallows its own errors and returns ``-1`` on failure.

Knowledge-base snapshots: the full profile a run was audited against
(``report.knowledge.profile``) is stored once per distinct content in
``kb_snapshots`` and linked from the row (``kb_snapshot_id``); the saved
report JSON carries only the hash, and :func:`get` puts the profile back.
Snapshots no row points to any more are deleted with the rows.

Performance headline: the target's p50 latency / TTFT / decode speed (see
:func:`_perf_headline`) is stored in its own columns when a row is saved, so
the list and trend views never parse ``report_json``. ``perf_done`` marks a
row whose headline has been computed, which tells "no performance data" (all
three NULL) apart from "not computed yet". Rows saved before those columns
existed are backfilled once after the migration; any row still unmarked (a
failed backfill, or a row written by an older zing) is computed when it is
first read and written back.

``PRAGMA user_version`` records that the schema is current, so connections to
a migrated database skip the schema check; a deleted or replaced database file
starts again at 0.
