"""Real context window & truncation detector — the headline check.

Measures the largest prompt the relay can actually ingest and recall a needle
from, and compares it to the advertised context window. A relay that silently
truncates, summarizes, or RAG-shims long prompts will recall well below its
claim, or fail a needle buried in the middle while passing start and end. zing
reports the measured divergence; it never asserts fraud outright.

Scoring follows the published ``SCALE`` (method "deductions"): the score starts
at 100, the window verdict deducts the share of the declared window that did not
recall (100 - measured/declared x 100), and a needle lost in the middle deducts
15. Without a declared window the measurement is reported but not scored.
