"""Multimodal (vision) capability verification detector.

A relay can claim a vision-capable model yet quietly route to a text-only
substitute that simply *says* it can see, or that hallucinates an answer. This
detector settles the question with a known-answer image probe: it generates a
small solid-color PNG at runtime (stdlib only — no Pillow), sends it inline as a
data URI alongside a one-word color question, and checks whether the model names
the color it could only know by actually looking.

The image is a single distinctive, hard-to-blind-guess color (orange,
RGB 255,140,0): not a primary color a text-only model could land on by chance,
and not the canonical "red/green/blue" a guesser reaches for first. A text-only
model that cannot see the bytes has no way to produce "orange" reliably.

Verdict is deliberately false-positive averse. Correct color -> PASS (vision
delivered). A refusal / no color / wrong color -> WARN (MEDIUM): the claimed
vision is not being delivered, possibly a text-only substitute. Transport error
or empty response -> INCONCLUSIVE. This check never escalates to HIGH on its own;
one image is suggestive, not conclusive proof of substitution.

Budget: a single chat completion.
