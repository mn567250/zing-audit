"""FastAPI app for `zing serve` — serves the SPA and streams live audits over SSE.

Endpoints:
  GET  /                     the single-page app (classic UI)
  GET  /v2/…                 the v2 UI, served side by side for A/B comparison;
                             ?ui=v1|v2 on any page picks one (remembered in the
                             `zing_ui` cookie)
  GET  /api/health           {ok, version}
  GET  /api/kb/profiles      the merged knowledge base with sources + your kb.db entries
  GET  /api/kb/prompt        research prompt for an external AI (?model=&provider=)
  POST /api/kb/scan          check uploaded profile YAML (writes nothing)
  POST /api/kb/import        check + store profile YAML in kb.db
  GET  /api/kb/export        your kb.db entries as YAML
  POST /api/models           list a relay's /models (connection check + model ids)
  POST /api/audit/stream     run an audit; stream detector progress, batched
                             per-request timing records and the final report
                             as Server-Sent Events (text/event-stream)
  POST /api/jobs             queue an audit as a background job (same body as
                             /api/audit/stream); it runs on whatever page is open
  GET  /api/jobs             queued and running audits (and running monitors),
                             recently finished ones too, with progress
  GET  /api/jobs/{id}/events the job's events as SSE: the log so far, then live
  POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel stop a queued or running job
  POST /api/report/export    a report (JSON body) rendered as a download
                             (?format=json|md|html|pdf)
  GET  /api/secret           the monitors' master key: state, fingerprint,
                             allowed actions (never the key)
  POST /api/secret/new       a new master key, shown once …
  POST /api/secret/new/confirm  … and adopted once typed back {key}
  POST /api/secret/unlock    enter the master key {key} after a restart
  POST /api/secret/lock      forget it; monitors pause
  POST /api/secret/reset     the key is lost: drop the encrypted API keys

The audit runs in-process with the same `run_audit` the CLI uses; a progress
callback pushes per-detector events into a queue the SSE generator drains. The
final report is the model's own redacted `model_dump` (API key fingerprinted,
relay text scrubbed), so nothing secret crosses to the browser.

Every audit runs as a job (zing/web/jobs.py): audits of the same relay are
queued one after another so they never skew each other's measurements;
different relays run in parallel. /api/audit/stream ties its job to the
stream (closing the page stops it); /api/jobs detaches it from the page.
