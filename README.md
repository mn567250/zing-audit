**zing** is a local-first tool that audits whether an API relay (reseller /
proxy) actually serves the model it claims to — or quietly substitutes a cheaper
one, truncates your context window, fakes streaming, or inflates token billing.
In short: do you get what you paid for? It speaks the **OpenAI Chat Completions
API**, the **Anthropic Messages API** and the **OpenAI Responses API**
(`/v1/responses`) — auto-detected, or forced with `--api openai|anthropic|responses`.

You point it at a relay endpoint and the model it claims to serve; zing runs a
battery of black-box probes, compares what it observes with a bundled knowledge
base of **98 model profiles from 7 providers**, and gives a clear, evidence-backed
verdict — on the command line, in a local web UI, or as JSON for another tool or
LLM.

> zing reports **black-box evidence of divergence and risk, not cryptographic
> proof of fraud.** See [Responsible use](#responsible-use).

This README is for people who **use** zing. How zing is built, tested and
released is in the [Developer guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md); how every check works
and is scored is in the [Methodology](docs/METHODOLOGY.md).

## Why

The relay-key market is full of "GPT-4o for 1/10th the price" offers. Many are
honest. Some are not — and the dishonest ones are hard to catch by eye:

- You ask for `gpt-4o`; you're quietly served `gpt-4o-mini` or an open model.
- The relay advertises a 1M-token context but silently truncates to 32K.
- "Streaming" is the full response buffered and re-chunked, with no latency win.
- Reported `usage` tokens are inflated, so your balance burns faster than it should.
- A model that should support tool calling / JSON mode quietly doesn't.

zing turns "this feels off" into a reproducible report.

## Install

Requires Python 3.10+. Every option below provides the `zing` command.

### With pip

```bash
# from PyPI
pip install zing-audit

# or from source
git clone https://github.com/cenbonew/zing
cd zing
pip install -e .
```

### With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
# from PyPI, as a standalone tool on your PATH
uv tool install zing-audit

# or run it once without installing
uvx --from zing-audit zing --help

# or from source, into a project-local virtual environment
git clone https://github.com/cenbonew/zing
cd zing
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
source .venv/bin/activate       # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

You can also install straight from the Git repository without cloning:
`uv tool install git+https://github.com/cenbonew/zing`.

### Optional extras

- `tokenizers` — accurate OpenAI-family token counting in the billing audit.
- `web` — the local web UI (`zing serve`).
- `pdf` — PDF reports (`--format pdf`, and the PDF download in the web UI), rendered
  from the HTML report by [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/), which needs the Pango
  system library (preinstalled on most Linux desktops; `brew install pango` on macOS).

```bash
pip install 'zing-audit[tokenizers,web,pdf]'      # pip, from PyPI
pip install -e '.[tokenizers,web,pdf]'            # pip, from source
uv tool install 'zing-audit[tokenizers,web,pdf]'  # uv, from PyPI
uv pip install -e '.[tokenizers,web,pdf]'         # uv, from source
```

### With Docker (web UI only)

From a source checkout:

```bash
docker build -t zing .
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 -v zing-data:/data zing
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Always publish the port to `127.0.0.1` as shown. Details and environment
variables: [Developer guide → Docker](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#docker) and
[docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md).

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) audit a relay against what it claims (model id + provider hint)
export ZING_API_KEY=sk-your-relay-key
zing check \
  --base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 \
  --api-key env:ZING_API_KEY \
  --model gpt-4o \
  --suite standard

# 2) the strongest check: compare against a trusted baseline of the same model
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
zing compare \
  --target-base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 --target-api-key env:ZING_API_KEY --target-model gpt-4o \
  --baseline-base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 --baseline-api-key env:OPENAI_API_KEY --baseline-model gpt-4o \
  --suite deep

# 3) audit an Anthropic-native (Messages API) relay — the protocol is auto-detected
#    from the base_url/model, or forced with --api anthropic
zing check --base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 --model claude-opus-4-8 \
  --api-key env:ZING_API_KEY --api anthropic

# 4) confirm a suspected substitution: audit the relay's REAL model id against the
#    profile it's sold as (here: a Doubao model passed off as deepseek-v4-flash)
zing check --base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 --api-key env:ZING_API_KEY \
  --model doubao-seed-2-0-lite --claimed-model deepseek-v4-flash

# 5) list the models an endpoint advertises
zing models --base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 --api-key env:ZING_API_KEY

# 6) inspect the knowledge base
zing kb            # every profile, with its source
zing kb deepseek   # one provider

# 7) generate a config you can commit
zing init          # writes zing.yaml
zing check -c zing.yaml
```

API keys can be given literally, as `env:VAR` or as `file:/path`; reports only
ever contain a fingerprint of the key. A full config file is in
[`examples/zing.yaml`](examples/zing.yaml).

### As a tool for an LLM / agent

zing is built to be driven by another program or model. Everything goes to stdout
as JSON, errors included, and the exit code is the gate.

```bash
# lean, agent-friendly verdict (~5x smaller than --json: no bulky evidence)
zing check --base-url ... --model gpt-4o --compact | jq .verdict.risk

# full structured report when you need every finding's evidence
zing check --base-url ... --model gpt-4o --json

# budget first: which detectors run + estimated API calls, WITHOUT making any
zing check --base-url ... --model gpt-4o --suite deep --dry-run --json

# gate on the exit code (1 if risk >= medium, or the score is below --fail-under);
# config/usage errors exit 2, as JSON
zing check --base-url ... --model gpt-4o --compact --fail-on-risk medium

# machine-readable discovery
zing kb --json                      # the whole knowledge base
zing models --base-url ... --json   # what an endpoint advertises
```

In `--json`/`--compact` mode a bad config prints `{"error": {...}}` (exit 2)
instead of a human message, so a pipeline can parse failures uniformly.

## Web UI (`zing serve`)

Prefer point-and-click? A local web UI wraps the same engine — no CLI needed.

```bash
pip install 'zing-audit[web]'     # or: uv tool install 'zing-audit[web]'
zing serve                        # opens http://localhost:8000
```

Enter the **Relay URL**, the **API key** and the model; optionally a **Claimed
model** (if the relay sells it under another name), a **Declared provider** and a
trusted baseline (**Compare against a trusted baseline**). **Fetch models** lists
what the relay advertises, and picking one fills in the model and its provider.
Then **Start audit** and watch the checks run **live**: every check shows its
score and how long it took, and a check with findings expands to show the
evidence. The result is a shareable verdict report: grade, the per-dimension
checks with their scoring scales, plain-language findings and the performance
section (in the new UI also an **Execution log** of every detector).

Everything runs on your machine: a key typed in the browser reaches only your
local zing server and the relay you audit, never a third party. See
[Privacy and local data](#privacy-and-local-data).

### Pages

The web UI comes in two versions that share the same server and data. The
**classic UI** opens at `/`; its **Try the new UI** link switches to the **new
UI** under `/v2/`, and the new UI's **Classic UI** link switches back. The
choice is remembered per browser.

| Page | Classic UI | New UI | What it is for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Audit** | `/` | `/v2/` | Audit a relay (optionally against a baseline) and read the report |
| **Console** | `/console` | — | The same audit as a compact, log-style console |
| **Tools** | `/tools` | `/v2/tools` | Embedding and rerank audits |
| **History** | `/history` | `/v2/history` | Every audit run on this machine, grouped by relay + claimed model, with trends |
| **Monitors** | `/watches` | `/v2/watches` | Scheduled re-audits with webhook alerts |
| **Models** | — | `/v2/kb` | Browse the knowledge base and add your own model profiles |

The new UI adds: filters and configurable trends (score, grade, latency p50,
tokens/s) on **History**; **Schedule as monitor** on every History run; **Download
report** in every format; a theme switch (Auto theme / Light / Dark); and the
**Models** page.

### Languages

A language dropdown in the header of every page switches the UI between
**🇬🇧 English** (default), **🇨🇳 Chinese** (the original UI), **🇫🇷 French**,
**🇪🇸 Spanish**, **🇵🇹 Portuguese**, **🇮🇹 Italian** and **🇩🇪 German**; the choice
is remembered per browser.

Reports downloaded from the UI (**Download report**: JSON, Markdown, HTML or PDF)
follow the selected language: the JSON keys, enum values (`risk_level`,
`status`, `severity`, …), ids and evidence stay exactly as in the CLI's report
(the JSON is still a valid zing report), while the human-readable values
(verdict headline and summary, finding titles and summaries, recommendations,
detector names, notes) are translated, and the file name carries the language
(`zing-report.de.json`, `zing-report.de.pdf`). The section headings of the
Markdown/HTML/PDF files are English. The CLI's own `--format json|md|html|pdf`
reports stay English.

**Prompts sent to the audited endpoint do not follow the UI language.** Every
text zing sends to an LLM API is English, so the same relay gets the same
verdict whoever reads the report (answer checks and token estimates are
calibrated to these exact texts). The only exceptions are knowledge-base
fingerprints whose language *is* the measurement — for example the Chinese
fluency, tokenizer and self-identification probes of China-native models. Each
report records the probe languages it actually used (`prompt_languages`, e.g.
`["en", "zh"]`).

## What it checks

zing scores ten dimensions. The three **core dimensions** — model identity,
context window and capability claims — most directly reveal a bait-and-switch
and carry the most weight. The names are the ones the web UI and reports use.

| Dimension | Id | Weight | What it catches |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Model identity** | `model_identity` | 21 | Silent model downgrade or substitution — self-identification, knowledge cutoff, tokenizer fingerprints, the echoed `model` field; optionally an LLM judge |
| **Context window** | `context_window` | 19 | Silent context truncation (claims 1M, recall fails at 32K) and lost-in-the-middle from cheap RAG/summarization shims, via needle-in-a-haystack and binary search |
| **Capability claims** | `capability` | 13 | Tool calling / JSON mode / JSON schema / max-output claims that aren't delivered (or are *over*-delivered, hinting at a substitute); **vision** — a model claiming image input must read a generated known-answer image |
| **Protocol compliance** | `protocol` | 8 | Wire conformance: multi-turn, stop sequences, error schema; every request parameter accepted (and honored where visible), every response attribute present; response caching that ignores temperature/seed |
| **Billing & usage** | `billing` | 8 | Token/usage inflation and missing or unverifiable usage accounting, via an independent tokenizer estimate |
| **Connectivity** | `connectivity` | 7 | Endpoint reachability and the advertised `/v1/models` list |
| **Streaming authenticity** | `streaming` | 6 | Fake streaming (buffer-then-chunk), from chunk count and inter-chunk timing |
| **Concurrency reliability** | `reliability` | 6 | Success rate and latency under concurrent load (HTTP 429 throttling counted separately) |
| **Transport security** | `security` | 6 | HTTPS, header hygiene, secret echo; a hidden injected system prompt; in-flight tampering of answers and tool calls (known-answer canaries); prompt-prefix caching (timing) |
| **Performance** | `performance` | 6 | How *consistent* latency, time to first token and throughput are, the failure rate and the slowdown under load; speed only against a reference (see [Performance](#performance)) |

The [Methodology](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) describes every probe, which relay trick
it maps to, its scoring scale and its false-positive caveats.

## How the verdict is reached

In short (the [Methodology](docs/METHODOLOGY.md#how-zing-scores) has the details):

- Every detector publishes its **scoring scale** — each possible outcome of each
  check with its points — and the web UI shows it under **Scoring scale**.
- A **dimension score** is the equal-weight mean of its detectors' scores. A
  HIGH/CRITICAL finding forces **Fail** and a MEDIUM finding lifts **Pass** to
  **Warning**, whatever the score. Reports explain this per dimension under
  **Dimension details**; in the web UI each row of **Per-dimension checks**
  expands into the same details.
- The **overall health score** is the weighted mean of the dimensions that ran
  (weights above), rated A (≥ 90), B (≥ 80), C (≥ 70), D (≥ 60) or F.
- The **risk verdict** is driven by finding severity, not by the score:

| Risk | Label in the UI | When |
|---|---|---|
| `inconclusive` | Insufficient signal | No core dimension produced a usable result (relay unreachable, model not in the knowledge base, or a `custom` run without a core dimension) |
| `high` | Bait-and-switch | A CRITICAL finding, a HIGH/CRITICAL finding in a core dimension, or two or more HIGH findings |
| `medium` | Deviations found | Exactly one HIGH finding outside the core dimensions, or a MEDIUM finding in a core dimension |
| `low` | Mostly trustworthy | Any other MEDIUM finding |
| `clean` | Consistent (likely genuine) | None of the above |

Findings of the connectivity dimension never raise the risk: a relay that is down
or throttled could not be assessed, which is not evidence of a different model.
The verdict's **confidence** (low / medium / high) grows with the number of core
dimensions that produced a result, a baseline and the LLM judge.

## Suites

| Suite | Detectors | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `smoke` | connectivity, security | very low |
| `standard` | + protocol, protocol_request, protocol_response, model_identity, capability, streaming, billing, reliability | low–medium |
| `deep` | + context_window, determinism, vision, injected_prompt, integrity, prompt_cache, performance, quality_judge (with `--judge`) | higher (long-context and timing probes cost tokens) |
| `full` | the detectors of `deep`, with performance measured both streaming and non-streaming | highest |
| `custom` | only the dimensions you pick, at `deep` depth | depends on the selection |

The context-window probe is bounded by `--max-context-tokens` (default 200K) so
auditing a 1M-token model stays affordable. `--only` / `--skip` run or leave out
single detectors by id.

### Custom suite

Run just the dimensions you care about, which saves time and tokens. Every
detector of each selected dimension runs, as on `deep`:

```bash
zing check --base-url ... --model gpt-4o -D protocol -D performance
zing check --base-url ... --model gpt-4o --suite custom --dimension billing,streaming
```

`--dimension/-D` is repeatable or comma-separated and implies `--suite custom`;
in a config file use `run.dimensions: [protocol, performance]`. The dimensions
are `connectivity`, `protocol`, `context_window`, `model_identity`, `capability`,
`streaming`, `billing`, `reliability`, `security` and `performance`. In the web
UI, the `custom` suite button opens the same choice (**Dimensions to run**) on
the audit page, the console and the monitors.

The **overall score is the weighted mean of the selected dimensions only**;
dimensions you left out are reported as "not selected". The risk verdict needs
at least one core dimension (model identity, context window, capability claims):
without one, it is *inconclusive*.

## Performance

Every report carries a **performance** section: latency, time to first token
(TTFT), decode and end-to-end tokens/s, inter-chunk latency and jitter,
error/timeout/429 rates, a network breakdown (TCP connect, TLS, a `GET /models`
round trip, server time) and cold start, each as count / min / mean / p50 / p75 /
p90 / p95 / p99 / max / stdev.

When the dedicated probe runs, it scores the **Performance** dimension. The score
is about **consistency**, not raw speed, so a slow but steady endpoint (a local
or self-hosted model) is not marked down for not being a data centre:

| Check | Scored on |
|---|---|
| latency / TTFT consistency | tail ratio p90 ÷ p50 (≤ 1.3 steady 100 · ≤ 1.75 stable 85 · ≤ 2.5 variable 65 · above: erratic 40); needs ≥ 10 samples |
| throughput consistency | tail ratio p50 ÷ p10 of tokens/s, same bands |
| errors | failed probe requests: ≤ 2% 100 · ≤ 10% 80 · above: 50 (429s not counted) |
| load stability | burst p50 latency ÷ sequential p50: ≤ 1.5x 100 · ≤ 3x 80 · above: 55 |
| cache hit | unique prompts answered from a cache: 60 |
| reference | tokens/s against the trusted baseline, or else the knowledge base's published range for the model: in line 100 · slower 80 (informational, never a failure) · ≥ 2x faster 60 (hints at a smaller model) · no reference: not counted |

Performance findings are at most low severity: they move the score, never the
risk verdict. Without the probe (`standard` without a baseline, `smoke`), the
dimension does not run and drops out of the overall score.

- **standard** collects the section from the audit's own requests.
- **deep / full / custom** add a dedicated probe: 100 uncacheable requests of 128
  output tokens (a random request id opens every prompt; no cache or reasoning
  parameters are sent) plus a burst at `--concurrency`. Tune it with
  `--performance-requests` (0 disables) and `--performance-max-tokens`.
- The probe streams by default; `--performance-non-streaming` (or the
  **Streaming / Non-streaming** switch in the web UI) measures relays that cannot
  stream. **full** measures both modes, interleaved, and reports them side by side.
- **compare** runs the probe on both endpoints, alternating requests, and adds a
  target-vs-baseline table (5 requests per side on `standard`, too few for the
  consistency checks) whose differences are marked green ✓ where the target is
  better and red ✗ where it is worse.

Tokens are counted twice — from the relay's `usage` and locally — so throughput
is measurable even when `usage` is missing. A percentile is shown only with
enough samples (p90 from 10, p95 from 20, p99 from 100). The JSON report keeps
every request's timings (numbers only, no text); the HTML report and the web UI
chart them over the audit's timeline.

## Compare mode and the LLM judge

zing has two detection modes:

- **Pure code (default):** every detector except `quality_judge` decides by
  deterministic code — fingerprints, the context sweep, billing arithmetic,
  streaming timing. No second model is needed; results are reproducible.
- **Code + LLM hybrid (`--judge`):** additionally asks a *trusted* judge model
  (configured separately, never the target) whether the target's answers read
  like the claimed model — fuzzy signals such as quality and reasoning depth that
  pure code can't decide. This is the `quality_judge` detector.

```bash
zing check --base-url ... --model gpt-4o --suite deep --judge \
  --judge-base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 --judge-api-key env:OPENAI_API_KEY --judge-model gpt-4o-mini
```

**Compare mode** (`zing compare`, or **Compare against a trusted baseline** in
the web UI) runs the same probes against a trusted baseline of the claimed model
at the same time. It is the strongest confirmation path: identity answers,
rejected request parameters, tampering canaries and performance are all judged
side by side, and only a baseline lets the verdict's confidence reach *high*.
Without `--judge-base-url`, compare mode uses the baseline as the judge.

## Monitoring

Relays can serve the real model today and quietly swap it next week. `zing watch`
re-audits on a schedule, records each run to the history, and alerts a webhook
when the risk crosses a threshold or **regresses** versus the previous run.

```bash
zing watch --base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 --api-key env:ZING_API_KEY \
  --model gpt-4o --suite standard --interval 3600 \
  --alert-on medium --webhook "$FEISHU_WEBHOOK" \
  --alert-lang en                                     # or --once for cron
```

Alerts are formatted for **Slack / Feishu / DingTalk / generic JSON**,
auto-detected from the webhook URL, and written in the alert language — English
by default; `--alert-lang en|zh|fr|es|pt|it|de`. The generic JSON payload keeps
its keys and machine values (`risk_level`, `score`, …) language-neutral,
translates the human-readable ones (`text`, `headline`, `key_findings`) and
reports the `language`.

**In the web UI**, `zing serve` runs the same monitors in a background scheduler
inside the server process, stores every run in **History** and sends the same
webhook alerts:

- **New UI:** open a run in **History** and choose **Schedule as monitor**. zing
  copies that run's configuration (relay, model, claimed model, provider, suite,
  custom dimensions) into a paused monitor on the **Monitors** page; set its
  interval and API key there (History never stores keys) and switch it on.
  Interval, key, **Alert threshold**, webhooks and **Alert language** can be
  edited in place on each monitor.
- **Classic UI:** fill in the form on the **Monitors** page and **Add monitor**.

Each monitor has its own alert language (defaulting to the UI language), can be
run now, paused or deleted, and pins the knowledge-base profile it was created
with until you re-pin it. Keys are stored only in your local data directory and
are never sent back to the browser.

## Embedding, rerank, image and audio audits

These endpoints return vectors, rankings, images or audio instead of chat, so
zing audits them with focused, standalone auditors instead of the ten-dimension
chat pipeline. Each prints a verdict and supports `--json` and `--fail-on-risk`.

### Embeddings and rerank

```bash
# The expected vector dimension is resolved from the knowledge base for the claimed model.
zing embed --base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 \
           --model text-embedding-3-large --claimed-model text-embedding-3-large --fail-on-risk high

# Or give the expected dimension directly:
zing embed --base-url ... --model my-embed --claimed-dimensions 1024 --json

# Rerank: a built-in known-answer probe — a genuine reranker must rank the
# obviously relevant document first.
zing rerank --base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 --model my-rerank
```

`embed` checks connectivity, **dimension match** (the returned vector length
against the claimed model's native dimension — the headline bait-and-switch
signal: a relay claiming 3072-d `text-embedding-3-large` but returning 1024-d
serves a substitute), determinism (same input → cosine ≈ 1), distinctness
(unrelated inputs → cosine well below 1) and the echoed `model` field. Bundled
profiles: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536), `text-embedding-3-large`
(3072), `text-embedding-ada-002` (1536), Qwen `text-embedding-v3`/`-v4` (1024).

Both are also on the web UI's **Tools** page (**Embedding audit**, **Rerank
audit**), where the rerank probe can be replaced by your own query and documents.

### Image and audio (TTS) generation

Image generation (`POST /v1/images/generations`) and text-to-speech
(`POST /v1/audio/speech`), decoded with the Python standard library only — image
dimensions from the header bytes (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP), WAV duration via `wave`.

```bash
# Does a relay claiming DALL·E 3 actually return the requested 1792x1024? A
# downscaled or wrong-size image (or a size outside the claimed model's native
# sizes, from the knowledge base) is the headline bait-and-switch signal.
zing image --base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 --api-key env:RELAY_KEY \
  --model dall-e-3 --claimed-model dall-e-3 --size 1792x1024 --fail-on-risk high

# Does a relay claiming tts-1-hd return real audio whose length scales with the
# input (not a fixed placeholder, not HTML/JSON masquerading as audio)?
zing audio --base-url https://relay.example.com/v1 --api-key env:RELAY_KEY \
  --model tts-1-hd --voice alloy --format wav --save clip.wav
```

`image` checks connectivity, a valid and decodable format, **size match**
(decoded width × height against the request and the claimed model's native
sizes — FAIL/HIGH on a mismatch), distinctness (two prompts → different images,
catching a fixed placeholder), count and the `model` field. `audio` checks
connectivity, container/format validity, that the format is honored, a
non-trivial duration that scales with the input, distinctness and the `model`
field. The knowledge base ships OpenAI DALL·E 2/3, gpt-image-1,
tts-1/tts-1-hd/gpt-4o-mini-tts and Qwen image/TTS profiles.

## Use in CI (GitHub Action)

Gate any workflow on a relay audit with the bundled composite action. It runs
`zing check --compact --fail-on-risk`, exposes `risk` / `score` / `rating` as
outputs, writes a summary to the run and fails the job when the risk gate trips.

```yaml
jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: zing
        uses: cenbonew/zing@v0.11.0         # pin to a release tag
        with:
          base-url: https://relay.example.com/v1
          api-key: ${{ secrets.RELAY_API_KEY }}   # caller secret; never echoed
          model: gpt-4o
          fail-on-risk: high
      - run: echo "risk=${{ steps.zing.outputs.risk }} score=${{ steps.zing.outputs.score }}"
```

The relay key is forwarded through an environment variable (`--api-key env:…`),
so it never appears on a command line. See [docs/CI.md](docs/CI.md) for every
input and output and a deploy-gating example.

## Knowledge base

zing judges a relay against the **profile** of the model it claims: native
context window, max output, knowledge cutoff, tokenizer, capability flags,
identity keywords and behavioral fingerprints. The packaged profiles cover
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM and Moonshot
(`zing kb` lists them). There are three layers, later ones winning:

1. **Packaged** profiles, one YAML file per provider in
   [`zing/knowledge/data/`](zing/knowledge/data).
2. **A directory of your own YAML files**: `--kb-dir ./my-profiles` (repeatable)
   or `ZING_KB_DIR`.
3. **Your entries** (`kb.db` in the data directory), added without YAML files
   or an editable install:
   - in the web UI's **Models** page (`/v2/kb`): **Add a model** → **Copy the
     research prompt** into the AI assistant of your choice, upload or paste the
     YAML it answers with, then **Check and save**. **All profiles** lists every
     profile with its source; **Which profile does a model id use?** shows how an
     id resolves; **Your entries** can be exported as YAML;
   - on the CLI: `zing kb-prompt <model>`, `zing kb-import <file>` (add `--check`
     to only check it) and `zing kb-export`.

Before storing an entry zing checks it: schema and limits, unsafe regular
expressions, every prompt it would send, and model ids that would resolve to a
different profile. A model of yours with a packaged id replaces it (reported as
*shadowing* it), but never changes a packaged provider's own settings;
fingerprints are merged by id. `zing check` and `zing serve` use exactly the
same profiles; `--no-user-kb` (or `ZING_NO_USER_KB=1`) leaves your entries out.

Every report records the profile it audited against (`knowledge`: provider,
model, how the id matched, its source, and a full snapshot with its content
hash), so a report stays verifiable after the knowledge base changes.

## Reports

`zing check` and `zing compare` print a verdict and write the report to
`reports/` (`--out-dir`) as JSON, Markdown and HTML, plus PDF when the `pdf`
extra is installed (`--format all`, the default); `--format json|md|html|pdf`
writes one format. `--json` and `--compact` print to stdout instead.

```

A report contains the verdict (risk, confidence, score, rating), the key
findings with recommendations, the per-dimension scores and **Dimension
details**, every detector's findings with evidence, the performance section, the
knowledge-base profile used and the probe languages. Relay-controlled text is
redacted and escaped before it is written.

## Privacy and local data

- **Local only.** `zing serve` listens on loopback only (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`,
  `localhost`), answers only to those host names and refuses cross-site
  requests; it has no login because nothing outside your machine can reach it.
  zing contacts only the endpoints you configure (target, baseline, judge,
  webhooks).
- **Keys.** Reports and history keep only a fingerprint of an API key. The
  monitors' keys are stored in plain text in your data directory, which is why
  it is owner-only.
- **Data directory.** `~/.zing` (or `ZING_DATA_DIR`), created `0700` with `0600`
  files: `history.db` (audit history), `watches.db` (monitors, including their
  keys) and `kb.db` (your knowledge-base entries). Delete the directory to
  remove everything.

## Responsible use

zing is a black-box auditing aid. It **cannot prove**:

- that a provider stores or trains on your prompts,
- that it always routes to one exact model (relays can route probabilistically),
- billing fraud beyond what independent token estimation can suggest.

Use reports for your own due diligence. **Do not publicly accuse a vendor** based
on a single run without reviewing sample size, cost settings and local law. Run
`zing compare` against a trusted baseline before drawing strong conclusions.
