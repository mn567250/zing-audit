"""Determinism & cache-correctness detector.

A relay that secretly caches responses to cut inference cost will return the
same text for an identical prompt regardless of sampling parameters. The tell is
sampling at ``temperature=1.0``: a genuine model should vary; byte-identical
output is a caching signal. Identity at ``temperature=0`` is expected and not
penalized — deterministic decoding is correct behavior there.

To avoid falsely accusing honest models, the caching call only fires when ALL of
several long high-temperature samples come back byte-identical, and it is
suppressed for reasoning models, which legitimately ignore/clamp sampling
parameters (e.g. deepseek-reasoner ignores temperature) and can repeat output.

Checks score points from the published scale ``SCALE``. Only the temperature=1.0
check is counted; the temperature=0 check is informational, and an inconclusive
check is not counted.
